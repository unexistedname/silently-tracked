Despised by his family and servants, Noein grew up to be a twisted character, and after a period of house arrest, he was evicted from his mansion. Instead of severing ties with his family, Noein was given an enclave on the kingdom's frontier and the title of lord. But the frontier is nothing but a vast expanse of untamed forest. Determined to develop the frontier and become the happiest lord of all, Noein sets out to cultivate the land. With the golem manipulation magic he mastered while under house arrest and the advanced knowledge he acquired from books, he plows the wasteland and begins farming. The first two stages of the project go smoothly, but the most important thing is that there are no residents in the territory. Noein immediately started to gather the people. His methods were extraordinary: he enlisted bandits to become his squires! He rounded up refugees and acquired a docile labor force! He induces the heart of a merchant's daughter to become a financier. The people of the fiefdom only show their respect and affection for him! Furthermore, his excellent skills in frontier development have attracted the attention of a large trading company and the high nobility? The story of a twisted lord's frontier development begins.",

      "Description": "Makoto Maruta is enjoying his Sunday afternoon with his sister, watching a bit of television. Makoto being jobless, but not for lack of trying. Shortly after his sister leaves the room, a summoning circle appears beneath his feet. In mere moments, he finds himself face to face with the Goddess of Space and Time, Astate, who, despite being impressed with his stats, insults him for his lack of the traditional \"cheat\" skill she was expecting. Rather than heeding his plea to send him back home, she calls it a waste of effort and dumps him in a forest, alone. He chances upon Goddess of Prophecy, Liana, in disguise, who grants him power, once he passes her Secret Test of Character, and directs him to the nearest town. Once he arrives, he tests his new powers to find the town has a population of five. Suspicious, but having no other viable option, he investigates to find a Zombie Apocalypse, grabs the nearest implement, a large log, and proceeds to eliminate the zombie threat, rescuing the Raislin sisters, and the infants later named Raa and Rea in the process. Thus begins his life in this new world of Manasthesia.",
