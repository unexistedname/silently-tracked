# A small personal project for tracking manga updates

Nothing more, that's it.

## **Feature:**
-   Tracking (scraping) with PlaywrightJS  
-   Update notifications via discord bot

## **Future implementations:**
- [ ] Website GUI using React (on progrss)
- [ ] Replace Playwright with request-based scraping for optimization (too lazy :)
- [ ] Interactive Discord bot features
- [ ] Ability to add new manga without modifying the code
- [ ] Support for tracking multiple websites
- [ ] Mirroring feature (basically same as the prev one)
